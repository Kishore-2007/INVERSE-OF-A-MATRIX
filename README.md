# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : import numpy as library
### Step 2: numpy array has been declared using a 3 x 3 matrix
### Step 3: Using the np.linalg.inv(a), we can find the inverse of the given matrix.
### Step 4: End the program

## Program:

```python
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: KISHORE.S
#RegisterNumber: 24900594

import numpy as np
a=np.array([[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]])
b=np.linalg.inv(a)
print(b)

```
